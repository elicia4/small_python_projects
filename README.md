1. [A small program](./requirements_sorter.py) to help you find a job.

   you're done, you get the final list of requirements sorted by popularity and
   a file with the same list.

1. [An IPv4 converter program](./ip_converter.py) to help you easily determine
   the network address, broadcast address, first and last usable addresses, and
   subnet mask based on an IP address and prefix length. For example, with an
   IP address of **43.109.23.12 / 8**:
