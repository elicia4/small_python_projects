1. [A small program](./requirements_sorter.py) to help you find a job.
   
   You enter job requirements from different job descriptions, the program
   reads them and figures out which ones are more frequent than others. 

   When you're done, you get the final list of requirements sorted by
   frequency and a file containing it.

1. [An IPv4 converter program](./ip_converter.py) to help you easily determine
   the network address, broadcast address, first and last usable addresses, and
   subnet mask based on an IP address and prefix length. For example, with an
   IP address of **43.109.23.12 / 8**:
